# Game-Development
A project created for a Game Development course. It was developed in C++ in Visual Studio using SDL2.

It is a 2D top-down game similar to classic Legend of Zelda games. The objective of the game is to collect all of the coins on each of the levels and reach the portal before losing three lives. Press enter to start from the main screen and WASD in order to control the character.

It uses open-source images, music, and sounds in order to create sprite sheets, sound effects, and tilesets
